gregtech.multiblock.fission_reactor.description=Fission Reactors use fuel rods placed together to create a sustained chain of fission reactions. These reactions generate heat (power) that may be soaked up by coolants, which can then be used inside turbines. For example, using distilled water as a coolant, each channel soaks up about 2 EU/t of heat per degree Kelvin and block of internal reactor depth.  The reactor can take on a variety of shapes. Its cross sections can be seen in JEI, and the reactor may extend 7 blocks up and down from the controller. Reactors can import and export fuel rods/coolants through special pairs of hatches on the top and bottom layers, respectively. Control rod hatches may also be placed on the top layer, and they give the user more control over the reactor. Inserting them more decreases the neutron multiplication rate "effective K" (shown as k_eff), a factor by which the power is continually multiplied by until it reaches the approximate max power. If k_eff is over 1, the reactor's power will eventually increase; if it's below 1, it will eventually decrease; and if it's around 1, it will stay stable. In fact, the reactor automatically shifts this over time, attempting to reach a stable equilibrium. This may be overridden manually, which you may want to do if the k_eff is over 1.05 to avoid it spiralling out of control and melting down. K_eff is also affected by neutron poisons inside the reactor, which will increase in concentration over time as the reactor runs (and still remain in a fairly high concentration for a while after). The rate at which k_eff "acts" is dependent on the mean generation time, which is how long it takes for the next generation of neutrons to be produced. This depends on the fuel rod (and can be seen in their tooltips), and it is mostly affected by delayed neutrons produced from decaying fission products. The power may then be modeled using an exponential function with a time constant of the mean generation time divided by (k_eff - 1). Control rods, fuel hatches, and coolant hatches all require special tubing beneath them to form correctly; check their tooltips to see which blocks to use. Once a reactor's hatches are filled, the reactor can be locked to begin operation, meaning that the types of items/fluids in the hatches can not be changed while the reactor operates. The placement of the fuel rods and coolant channels within the reactor is quite important. Neutrons produced by decaying atoms in the fuel rods can cause fissions in other fuel rods; therefore, reactors work far more effectively with more than one fuel rod channel. The chance that a neutron interacts with a fuel rod is increased if it is slowed down by a moderator, such as distilled water inside a coolant channel. As such, it can be helpful to put coolant channels between fuel rods to increase k_eff (and control rods do much the opposite). Fuel rods also decay at a rate proportional to the power; a 600 MJ fuel rod will deplete after 600 seconds of 1 MW, or alternatively 1 second of 600 MW. Note: if this multiblock receives maintenance problems, the coolant systems will occasionally seize up and stop working. However, coolant channels only operate when the hot coolant fluid is actually hotter than the reactor itself, and they can also only altogether export as much heat as the max power.
gregtech.multiblock.gas_centrifuge.description=The Gas Centrifuge can help in the purification process of isotopes, especially those of uranium. By repeatedly putting uranium hexafluoride into a gas centrifuge, one can obtain highly enriched uranium hexafluoride, which has a purity high enough to make nuclear fuels. Each block of length makes it perform one more recipe in parallel.
gregtech.multiblock.heat_exchanger.description=The Heat Exchanger can be used to take heat out from one fluid by either radiating it out into its surrounding environment or by transferring it into another fluid. This can be used with hot coolant from fission reactors to help generate steam for steam turbines.
gregtech.multiblock.spent_fuel_pool.description=The Spent Fuel Pool takes hot depleted fuel rods fresh from a fission reactor and cools them down to be processed later. It only works when the structure is fulled with water, you can do this by fill an input water with water, or place water blocks manually. Each block of length makes it perform 32 more recipes in parallel.
